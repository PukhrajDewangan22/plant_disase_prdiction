# Plant Disease Prediction and Precaution

This project predicts plant diseases using AI and suggests suitable precautions. It's built using Flask for the web interface and a dataset of plant images for training and evaluation. The application leverages machine learning to identify diseases based on input images and provides actionable recommendations.
